Idea: We created multiple one.js files to load balance the server. Nginx would do all the load balancing for us. Listening to different port numbers

Also created multiple sharedb.js file for different one.js files to write the sharedb information to. Not overloading sharedb js file. Changing port number on the 
reconnecting websockets

Put elastic search and mongodb on different servers
